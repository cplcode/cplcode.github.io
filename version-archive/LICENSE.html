CPL LICENSE AGREEMENT

Copyright 1993-2020 Paolo Luchini http://cplcode.net

This software includes a compiler intended to translate source code provided
by the user into intermediate source code that will be fed to a further compil-
er. A distinction is therefore needed between 1) software generated by this
software; 2) additional software (such as a further compiler) that is activated
by this software; and 3) this software. In the present text, "this software"
denotes the set of files accompanied by this license at the time of release.

1) The stream of characters spread over several files output by this software,
in its part representing the translation or the interpretation of original
input supplied by the user, is hereby assigned to the full property and
responsibility of the owner of the input, with no express or implied warranty
and no assurance that it actually is computer code suitable for any purpose
or that it is not harmful computer code. In addition the user is granted a
nonexclusive right to the remaining part of the output, originating
from the inclusion or the translation of libraries provided in this software,
to all applicable extent except forbidding others from using similar code.

2) This software may automate the operation of additional, not included,
software tools, such as but not limited to a C compiler or a graphics program,
on behalf of the user. It is the user's exclusive responsibility to obtain such
additional software, to comply with its license, and to ensure that it is used
appropriately.

3) Permission to use, copy, and distribute this software and its documentation
for any purpose with or without fee is hereby granted, provided that the above
copyright notice appear in all copies and that both that copyright notice and
the full text of this license appear in supporting documentation.

The Copyright holder (Paolo Luchini, Licenser) grants the limited rights
specified above to the person coming in possession of this software
(user, Licensee) on condition that Licensee accept the entirety of this
License Agreement; in lack of acceptance no rights are granted and the person
coming in possession of this software is invited to delete their copy and
to abstain from using or dealing in this software. Licensee acknowledges that
this software and its documentation, including the structure, sequence, and
organization of the software, is proprietary to Licenser, and that Licenser
retains exclusive worldwide ownership of the software and documentation and
all proprietary rights associated with the software and the documentation
in all formats and for all media currently in existence or which come into
existence in the future, including but not limited to the localized versions.
All rights to the software, including without limitation patents, copyrights
and rights granted by copyright-like laws, trade secrets, trade names,
trademarks (whether registered or unregistered), remain the sole and exclusive
property of Licenser, and Licenser shall be free to exploit such rights
without limitation.

Licensee further acknowledges that any modified or edited source code, and any
object code, binary code, embedded source code and documentation are
derivatives of this software and therefore are within the scope of Licensor's
copyright in this software. Distribution of this software or portions of it in
modified form is permitted if conditions above are met and in addition: changes
are clearly marked and attributed to their source; each modified file, as well
as the package, are given names differing from the original and do not
interfere with their use. Use of the original logo to refer to a modified form
is not permitted.

This software is provided "as is" without express or implied warranty to
the extent permitted by applicable law.
