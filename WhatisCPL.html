    <h2>What is CPL?</h2>

    <p> Three-letter acronyms collect many meanings: as to &quot;CPL&quot; <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CPL" target="_blank">Wikipedia</a> mentions more than twenty, including several Public Libraries, a Concealed Pistol License, a Microsoft Windows Control PaneL file, and a forgotten programming language that was the grandfather of C. Here we propose five:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Concealed Pointer Lookup</li>
      <li>Custom Parameter Lists</li>
      <li>Consistent Procedure Linkage</li>
      <li>Compiled Programming Language</li>
      <li>Conceived by Paolo Luchini</li>
    </ul>
    <p>This CPL, unrelated to the Cambridge Programming Language, is a fairly classical general-purpose programming language akin to FORTRAN or C (but in fact even more similar to the once common Pascal and Modula-2, for those who remember them), with some unique features. It was born out of the effort to provide the flexibility of C in handling pointers without the burden of *'s and &amp;'s, the function overloading of C++ without the verbosity of classes, and the cross-file enforcement of function prototypes of all these languages without the need for dedicated header or interface files.</p>
    <p>It also aims for the ease of use of interpreted languages like MATLAB or Python, without giving up the error-catching benefits of strong typing and the speed of compiled execution. CPL was thought out as a compiled language from the start; when used for computationally intensive tasks, it has the speed of compiled C. In fact, its compiler is implemented as a very efficient translator to C which then invokes the system C compiler, all this occurring behind the scenes at a single <code>makecpl</code> command. Only much later the <code>icpl</code> interpreter and text editor was added, with the ability to run a combination of interpreted and compiled modules, as well as any C library, from its console.</p>
    <p>To end this introduction, a hallmark aesthetic touch of CPL is the adoption of all three kinds of brackets for grouping mathematical expressions. While this might be a secondary feature to some, it just so much eases the human reading and proofreading of nested formulas.</p>

    <p><small>Though the <code>.cpl</code> file ending for CPL source files is unambiguous in unix and here to stay, it does have a small inconvenience in being banned from some email services because of malicious exploitation in <a href="https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/help/149648/description-of-control-panel-cpl-files" target="_blank">Microsoft Windows Control Panel</a> files. If you encounter this problem, just rename your <code>.cpl</code> files before sending them as email attachments.</small></p>
