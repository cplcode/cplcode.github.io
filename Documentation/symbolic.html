  <meta name="description" content="Language reference manual for CPL, a programming language designed and developed by Paolo Luchini during 1993-2021. CPL has bounds-checked arrays, subarray selections transparent to structure fields, overloaded functions, optional parameters, structured arrays, parentheses, brackets and braces used like in mathematics. Offered for download are an incremental, extensible compiler, interactive interpreter and ide text editor. Extensions include matrix operations, gnuplot graphics and symbolic math manipulation.">

<hr> <h2>Symbolic differentiation</h2>
The symbolic.cpl library adds symbolic differentiation capabilities to CPL. Symbolic differentiation is seamlessly integrated in the compiler, and is performed at compile time: any desired symbolic derivatives are determined during compilation, and inlined in the generated code. Contrary to most other symbolic-math environments, therefore, the purpose is not so much to generate user-readable derivatives as to generate (hopefully efficient) inline code.

Symbolic manipulation operates upon and generates <q>inline expressions</q>, which can be defined using the INLINE keyword or alternately using the #define (<a href="cpl.html#C-preprocessor">(cpl)C preprocessor</a>) construction. INLINE operates just like #define, with the addition that internally it places parentheses around its arguments (thus guarding against operator precedence problems), and that its rhs must be a well-formed algebraic expression rather than an arbitrary string, and can end at <q>;</q>, like all CPL instructions, rather than at end-of-line only. INLINE without arguments is also equivalent to, and interchangeable with, the == <a href="cpl.html#Deferred-assignment">(cpl)Deferred assignment</a> operator and, like any r.h.s. of this operator, may contain yet undeclared variables. At the later position where an inline expression or variable appears in an executable statement, code for it is actually generated just as for ==. If all the required declarations have not appeared before this later point, a compilation error results.

The derivative of an inline expression with respect to a symbolic variable &lt;svname&gt; (which is not allowed to contain an underscore in its name) is denoted by either

	D_&lt;svname&gt;( &lt;symbolic expression&gt; )

or

	D( &lt;symbolic expression&gt; , &lt;svname&gt; )

When the latter form is used, &lt;svname&gt; may also be an array element (in the usual indexed notation). The derivative of an inline expression is in turn an inline expression, and can be differentiated further, given a name or used in the definition of a new compound inline expression, or eventually appear in an executable statement.

Higher derivatives and more general compound differential operators, which take an expression as their argument, can be defined in a similar syntax. For example:

	INLINE laplacian(f)=D_x(D_x(f))+D_y(D_y(f))+D_z(D_z(f))

A mechanism is provided to associate a derivative with a user-defined expression (or more generally to override automatic differentiation): if a variable named <q>D_&lt;svname&gt;_&lt;vname&gt;</q> is declared, it will be preferentially used as the value of the derivative of variable &lt;vname&gt; with respect to variable &lt;svname&gt; wherever such differentiation is attempted. If no such variable is declared and &lt;vname&gt; was previously defined as an inline expression, its derivative will be automatically generated. If &lt;vname&gt; is undefined, an error will result. If &lt;vname&gt; was declared as an ordinary CPL VARIABLE (or CONSTANT) rather than as an inline expression, it will be treated as a constant the derivative of which is zero.

As a side effect, variable and function names starting with <q>D_</q> are reserved and should not be defined for other purposes when symbolic.cpl is in USE.
