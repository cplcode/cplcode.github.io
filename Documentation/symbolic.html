  <meta name="description" content="Language reference manual for CPL, a programming language designed and developed by Paolo Luchini during 1993-2022. CPL has bounds-checked arrays, subarray selections transparent to structure fields, overloaded functions, optional parameters, structured arrays, parentheses, brackets and braces used like in mathematics. Offered for download are an incremental, extensible compiler, interactive interpreter and ide text editor. Extensions include matrix operations, gnuplot graphics and symbolic math manipulation.">

<hr> <h1>Symbolic differentiation</h1>
The symbolic.cpl library adds concurrent symbolic differentiation to CPL. Symbolic differentiation is seamlessly integrated in the compiler, and is performed at compile time: any desired symbolic derivatives are worked out during compilation, and inlined in the generated code. Contrary to most other symbolic-math environments, therefore, the purpose is not so much to generate user-readable derivatives as to generate (hopefully effective) inline code while keeping the visible code as close to pen-and-paper notation as possible.

Symbolic manipulation operates upon and produces <a href="cpl.html#INLINE">(cpl)INLINE</a> FUNCTIONs. The INLINE FUNCTION declaration (with untyped arguments) operates similarly to <a href="cpl.html#Top">#define:(cpl)</a>C preprocessor: and is almost interchangeable with it, except that internally it places parentheses around arguments (thus guarding against operator precedence), and that its rhs must be a well-formed algebraic expression rather than an arbitrary string, and thus can end at <q>;</q> like all CPL instructions, rather than at end-of-line only as for #define. An INLINE FUNCTION without arguments is also interchangeable with the == <a href="cpl.html#Deferred-assignment">(cpl)Deferred assignment</a> operator. Being a symbolic construction, an inline expression can contain yet undeclared variables; at the later position where the inline expression directly or indirectly appears in an executable statement, code for it is actually generated just as for ==. If all the required declarations have not appeared before this later point, a compilation error will turn up.

The derivative of an INLINE FUNCTION with respect to a symbolic variable &lt;svname&gt; (which is not allowed to contain an underscore in its name) is denoted by either

	D_&lt;svname&gt;( &lt;function name&gt; )

or

	D( &lt;function name&gt; , &lt;svname&gt; )

When the latter form is used, &lt;svname&gt; may also be an array element (in the usual indexed notation). The derivative of an INLINE FUNCTION is another INLINE FUNCTION, and can be differentiated further, given a name or used in the definition of a new compound INLINE FUNCTION, or eventually appear in an executable statement.

Higher derivatives and more general compound differential operators, which take an expression as their argument, can be defined in a similar syntax. For example:

	INLINE FUNCTION laplacian(f)=D_x(D_x(f))+D_y(D_y(f))+D_z(D_z(f))

A mechanism is provided to associate a derivative with a user-defined expression (or more generally to override automatic differentiation): if a variable named <q>D_&lt;svname&gt;_&lt;fname&gt;</q> is declared, it will be preferentially used as the value of the derivative of function &lt;fname&gt; with respect to variable &lt;svname&gt; wherever such differentiation is attempted. If no such variable is declared and &lt;fname&gt; was previously defined as an INLINE FUNCTION, its derivative will be automatically generated. If &lt;fname&gt; is yet undeclared, or was declared as an ordinary CPL VARIABLE (or CONSTANT) rather than as an INLINE FUNCTION, it will be treated as a constant the derivative of which is zero.

As a side effect, variable and function names starting with <q>D_</q> are reserved and should not be declared for other purposes when symbolic.cpl is in USE.
