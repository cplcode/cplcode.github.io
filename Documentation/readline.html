<h1>Readline assisted console input</h1>

Bash-like command completion and command history are traditionally provided by
the GNU readline library, which supplies the familiar Tab and Up Arrow
commands, input logging and more. The purpose of readline is to allow the user 
to edit each command line before committing it, and to keep a history of
previous commands for rapid reuse.

In icpl, console input is handled through an independent implementation of the 
readline library (readlinedit.cpl, also available for user programs), which
combines the most essential features of the traditional readline and a
full-screen editor.

icpl readline accepts cursor-movement and other commands in one of three
equivalent ways: dedicated editing keys, vi-like single-letter commands, and
the mouse. Single-letter command mode is toggled in and out of by the Esc
key. Full-screen mode is toggled in and out of by F1 or Esc Space
(or by the Insert key when no text is currently selected). Any cursor movement
while Shift is pressed (or mouse movement with left button pressed) selects
text. For functions which admit an inverse (such as undo - redo or search
forward - search backward), Shift or right mouse button selects the inverse.
With the exception of Ctrl-i (Tab) and Ctrl-h (Backspace), Ctrl-&lt;key&gt; also
works as an alternative to Esc followed by the same lower-case key.

The full-screen editor can be accessed directly from a unix shell by giving the
command "edit &lt;file&gt; [+&lt;linenumber&gt;]". "edit" is actually a symbolic link
to the icpl executable script, which when called under a different name
executes that name as its first command. <a href="cpl.html#icpl%20command%20line">(cpl)icpl command line</a>.
In full-screen mode the command history shows up in a tidy full-screen editor,
and the Enter key is now entered as a regular newline. On return to readline
mode (when F1 or Esc Space is pressed again), the modified command
history is replayed through icpl as if this list of commands had been given
afresh when it was launched. Other editing keys work just as in readline mode,
except that history lines are now edited in place.

<h3>Readline mode</h3>

In readline mode the following editing keys are available:

- Left arrow (Esc h), right arrow (Esc l): move cursor
- Home (Esc ^), end (Esc $): beginning, end of line
- Ctrl-Home (Ctrl-^), Ctrl-End (Ctrl-$, Esc A): beginning, end of file
- Backspace: erase left
- Delete (Esc d): erase right
- Shift-delete (Esc D): erase line
- Up (Esc j), down arrow (Esc k): previous, next command in history. If a
  partial line is entered, only lines containing it become visible. Previous
  commands are immutable; when a character is added or deleted in a previous
  command, this is copied to the most recent position before being modified.
- PageUp (Esc f), pageDown (Esc b): move up or down until a paragraph of
  the same or lesser indentation.
- Tab: autocomplete keyword or identifier. Successive tabs move forward along
  the list of available completions; Shift-Tab moves backwards.
- Enter: commit command to icpl.
- F1, Esc Space: switch to full-screen mode.
- Esc u, Esc U: Undo, respectively redo, the last modification.
- Esc \, Ctrl-\: add next (special or control) character verbatim

<h3>An icpl-embedded full-screen editor</h3>

The following editing keys are available:

- Left arrow (Esc h), right arrow (Esc l): move cursor
- Home (Esc ^), End (Esc $): beginning, end of line
- Ctrl-Home (Ctrl-^), Ctrl-End (Ctrl-$, Esc A): beginning, end of file
- Backspace: erase left; Delete (Esc d): erase at cursor
- Shift-Delete (Esc D): erase line
- Up arrow (Esc j), down arrow (Esc k): previous, next line.
- PgUp (Esc p), PgDn (Esc n): move to prev or next paragraph of the same or
  lesser indentation.
- Tab: autocomplete keyword or identifier. Successive tabs move forward along
  the list of available completions; Shift-Tab moves backwards.
- F1, Esc Space: switch in and out of command-line mode.
- Esc u, Esc U: Undo, respectively redo, the last modification. (<a href="#Undo">Undo</a>)
- Esc a, Ctrl-a: add next (special or control) character verbatim.

Selection is achieved by cursor-moving keys with Shift pressed (<a href="#Select">Select</a>),
or by moving the mouse with its left button pressed. The center mouse button
copies the current selection.

Clicking the mouse on the bottom left corner, or pressing Esc m (or Esc
followed by any unassigned key), opens up a menu of editor commands. Clicking
the mouse on the bottom right corner opens context-sensitive help (through
the info program), about the currently selected word.

The full-screen editor can work on multiple screens (aka tabs), in addition
to the session log (command history). Simultaneously open buffers are
rotated into focus by clicking the mouse menu, which shows them as tabs, or
by pressing Esc &lt;digit&gt;.

A file is opened in a new screen with the "edit" icpl command (also available
in the menu, or as Esc e, or as the "edit" symbolic link from a unix shell),
and closed with the "close" menu command (aka Esc c or Ctrl-c). "Edit", or
Esc E, or right-clicking the "edit" menu button, opens the file to be edited in
a separate terminal window. The optional parameter +&lt;linenumber&gt; at the end of
the "edit" or "Edit" commands opens the file at the given line number.
The bottom status line contains the name of the currently displayed file and
the current line number. A star trailing the file name denotes whether the
in-memory buffer has been modified since last saved (and warns that changes
would be lost if not saved again). Closing an unsaved file elicits a prompt
asking for confirmation before exit.

"load" and "save" (Esc o and Esc s) respectively load (insert) a file at the
current cursor position and save the current in-memory buffer to a file,
with the original file name as a default. Ctrl-s immediately saves the
in-memory buffer to the original file name. If some text was just selected,
Esc s opens a "save selection as" prompt which saves the current selection
to a file.

"run" (Esc r) runs the current screen as a CPL program, after saving all
unsaved screens so that other possibly USEd files are up to date. By contrast,
switching into line mode always runs the session log, independent of which
screen is currently in view.

"attr" (Esc a) opens a menu of file buffer attributes.

<h3>Select, Insert and Delete</h3>

Selection of a text area is achieved either by keeping the left mouse button
pressed, or by clicking the right mouse button on the end of the selected area,
or by pressing shift together with any cursor motion key. Selection can apply
to the text comprised between the starting and ending selected positions or to
a rectangular area with the given corners (useful to select columns). Esc t
toggles in and out of rectangular mode. Esc w or double-clicking the mouse
selects a word under the cursor; if applied to an opening or closing bracket,
Esc w or double clicking selects the entire parenthesis. Esc n or triple click-
ing selects the line under the cursor. Esc "S", or clicking save with the right
mouse button, saves the current selection to a file.

Whenever text is selected, the Insert key (or Esc i, or Ctrl-v for those who
are accustomed to it) inserts (pastes) the selected text at the current cursor
position; no "copy" function is needed or provided. The Backspace or Delete key
(also aliased to Esc d, Esc x, Ctrl-x) erases the selected text if pressed
immediately after a selection. (At any other time these keys erase a single
character, the preceding one for Backspace.) Deleted text remains invisibly
selected and can be re-inserted after its deletion, up until a new selection is
performed. Typing a new character, or pressing Insert, immediately after a
selection without any intervening cursor movement replaces the current
selection. In this case the function of Insert changes to inserting the butlast
selection. Esc . also inserts either the butlast selection or the last typed
text, whichever is more recent.

In the way of example, in order to:

delete:           select, delete;
overtype:         select, type;
copy and paste:   select, move, insert;
cut and paste:    select, delete, move, insert;
copy and replace: select, move, select, insert;
cut and replace:  select, delete, move, select, insert.
type again:       type something, move, insert;
type and replace: type something, move, select, insert.

Esc !, respectively Esc @, turns the current selection to all uppercase or all
lowercase letters.

The copy-and-paste functionality of the underlying xterm-compatible terminal is
also available, and necessary if you want to copy some text from/to the X
clipboard. This is accessed by pressing Shift together with the corresponding
xterm mouse button (left button to select, center button to paste).

<h3>CPL syntax-sensitive indentation and completion</h3>

When a .cpl file is being edited, pressing Enter at the end of a freshly
modified line automatically:

1) indents the new line according to the contents of the previous line;
2) if the line is the opening of a new program block, like a subroutine, loop
or IF statement, it inserts the corresponding closing statement and the
   appropriate indentation for the block's contents;
3) it converts to upper case some CPL keywords when they are recognized as
   having been entered in lower case;
4) open brackets are automatically provided with a matching closing bracket;
   typing of the closing bracket is optional, and silently ignored if brackets
   match;
5) since CPL allows the usage of the three kinds of brackets like in
   mathematics (<a href="cpl.html#Parentheses">(cpl)Parentheses</a>), the editor automatically alternates
   the three kinds even if only one kind is typed in.

In addition, word completion using the Tab key is available in full-screen
just as in readline mode.

Where needed, the following explicit indentation commands are available:

Esc + : indent the current selection one more space to the right,
Esc - : unindent the current selection by one space to the left,
Esc = : even the margin of the current selection and indent as to CPL syntax.

<h3>Find and replace</h3>

"find" (Esc /) and "goto" (Esc g) seek the cursor to a given word or a given
line number. Esc ? (or clicking "find" with the right mouse button) seeks
backwards. The found string is automatically selected. In order to find and
replace, find a given text, exit Esc mode, and start typing the replacement.
Esc , repeats the last find. Esc / and Esc ? with an empty argument also repeat
the last find, possibly changing its direction. If some text is selected, Esc /
and Esc ? with an empty argument find the selected text.

Esc . inserts the most recently typed text or the butlast selected text (the
last selection being the string just found). It can be used to repeat the last
replacement. Esc &gt; is a shortcut for pressing Esc . and Esc , in a sequence,
and thus serves as replace-and-find-again. Keeping  Esc &gt; pressed is a means to
perform multiple replacements, possibly to the end (or to the beginning,
if searching backwards) of file.

Enter repeats the last command, possibly the last (forward or backward) find
or the last replace-and-find-again.

<h3>Undo and redo</h3>

Unlimited undo and redo functionality is supported, activated by Esc u and
Esc U respectively (or Esc z and Esc Z as alternates, or Ctrl-z and Ctrl-y,
but with the variation detailed below).
As a distinctive feature of this editor (shared by hardly any others, a
history-setting notable exception being emacs), memory of the undone edits
is retained even when further edits take place after an undo.

A standard editor allows the following trap to occur: you undo several times
with the purpose of inspecting how your text was at an earlier stage, but with
the intention to return to the present, and then before redo-ing, you accident-
ally hit a key (for example, redo is Ctrl-y and you hit y without Ctrl); now
your redo buffer is gone forever, and all you typed in the meanwhile is gone
with it.

Emacs and its kin keep memory of the complete history of commands including
undo's. You do not "redo" in emacs, you undo an undo. You never lose anything,
if no cap is posed on the length of the history, but once you start to "undo
an undo an undo" the interface may become confusing, and the distance to any
given past command increases rapidly.

In the CPL editor you can think of undo and redo commands as not changing any-
thing, just inspecting what you did before. It is when you start typing again
(or save) that actual changes take place. The next time you undo, you will roll
back the time series of changes without again seeing your past undo's, and roll
forward when you redo. If you redo all the way to the present nothing is
recorded, but otherwise the new position where you resume typing is. Save for
undo's and redo's, and for characters corrected with backspace immediately
after being written, the complete history of changes remains available since
the file was opened, and is never overwritten when you resume editing after
undoing your previous edits. It is, however, not stored with the file and lost
when this is closed.

For added flexibility, Esc z or Ctrl-z provides the traditional undo while
Esc u or Ctrl-u provides the full undo. History is not lost with either, and
redo is always full.

Multi-line movements (PgUp, PgDn, Ctrl-Home, Ctrl-End, find and go to line) can
also be undone, and are undone using the Esc b (back) key. Memory is only kept
up to the most recent text modification. Esc U, Esc Z and Esc R redo (reverse
undo) interchangeably. Ctrl-y is also available for those who are accustomed
to it.
