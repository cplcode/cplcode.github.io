Multilingual programming CPL library

In order to compile a CPL program using Neapolitan keywords, just put "USE napulitano" at its beginning; the napulitano.cpl file is self-explanatory and serves as its own usage instructions.

The tonap.fri script translates a standard CPL program to its Neapolitan version. For instance, copy your favourite program and the napulitano.cpl file to a test directory and then: tonap.fri program.cpl >program.nap; cpl make program.nap

Using napulitano.cpl and tonap.fri as examples, you can easily develop your own localization. This being a programming language, please consider that identifiers including keywords are restrained to using ASCII alphanumeric characters plus "_".
