    <h2>What is CPL?</h2>

    <p> Three-letter acronyms collect many meanings: as to &quot;CPL&quot; <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CPL" target="_blank">Wikipedia</a> mentions dozens, including several Public Libraries, some Cricket Premier Leagues, a Concealed Pistol License, a Microsoft Windows Control PaneL file, and an ancient programming language that was the ancestor of BCPL and C. Here we propose a fivefold expansion:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Concealed Pointer Lookup</li>
      <li>Custom Parameter Lists</li>
      <li>Consistent Procedure Linkage</li>
      <li>Compiled Programming Language</li>
      <li>Conceived by Paolo Luchini</li>
    </ul>
    <p>The present CPL, unrelated to the Cambridge or Combined Programming Language, is a fairly classical general-purpose programming language akin to FORTRAN or C (but in fact even more similar to the once common Pascal and Modula-2, for those who remember them), with some unique features. It was born out of the effort to provide the flexibility of C in handling pointers without the burden of *'s and &amp;'s, the function overloading of C++ without the verbosity of classes, and the cross-file enforcement of function prototypes of all modern languages without the need for dedicated header or interface files.</p>
    <p>It also aims for the ease of use of interpreted languages like MATLAB or Python, without giving up the error-catching benefits of strong typing and the sheer speed of compiled execution. CPL was thought out as a compiled language from the very beginning; when used for computationally intensive tasks, it has the speed of compiled C. In fact, its compiler is implemented as a nimble translator to C which then invokes the system C compiler; this action, as well as the re-making of any required modules that were modified, occurs behind the scenes at a single <code>makecpl</code> command. Only much later the <code>icpl</code> interpreter was developed, with the ability to run a combination of interpreted and compiled CPL modules, as well as any function provided by an existing C library, interactively from its console.</p>
    <p>To end this introduction, a hallmark aesthetic touch of CPL is the availability of all three kinds of brackets for grouping arithmetic (or other) expressions, just as you were taught in school. While this might be an unessential feature to some, alternating brackets just so much eases the human eye reading and proofreading nested parentheses.</p> 
    <p>&nbsp;</p>
    <p><small>Though the <code>.cpl</code> file ending for CPL source files is unambiguous in unix and here to stay, it does have a small inconvenience in being banned from some email services because of malicious exploitation in <a href="https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/help/149648/description-of-control-panel-cpl-files" target="_blank">Microsoft Windows Control Panel</a> files. If you encounter this problem, just rename your <code>.cpl</code> files to some other ending before sending them as email attachments.</small></p>
