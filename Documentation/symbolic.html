<hr> <h2>Symbolic differentiation</h2>
The symbolic.cpl library adds symbolic differentiation capabilities to CPL. Symbolic differentiation is seamlessly integrated in the compiler, and happens at compile time: any desired symbolic derivatives are determined during compilation, and inlined in the generated code. Contrary to most other symbolic-differentiation environments, therefore, the purpose is not so much to generate user-readable derivatives as to generate (hopefully efficient) code.

Symbolic manipulation operates upon and generates <q>symbolic expressions</q>, which can be assigned a symbolic name using the == operator and, like any r.h.s. of this operator, may contain yet undefined variables. At the later position where a symbolic expression or variable appears in an executable statement, code for it is actually generated just as in <a href="cpl.html#Deferred%20assignment">(cpl)Deferred assignment</a>. If all the necessary declarations have not appeared before this later point, a compilation error results.

The derivative of a symbolic expression with respect to a symbolic variable &lt;svname&gt; (which is not allowed to contain an underscore in its name) is denoted by either

	D_&lt;svname&gt;( &lt;symbolic expression&gt; )

or

	D( &lt;symbolic expression&gt; , &lt;svname&gt; )

When the latter form is used, &lt;svname&gt; may also be an array element (in the usual indexed notation).

Higher derivatives and more general compound differential operators, which take an expression as their argument, can be #define'd (<a href="cpl.html#C%20preprocessor">(cpl)C preprocessor</a>). For example:

	#define laplacian(f) D_x(D_x(f))+D_y(D_y(f))+D_z(D_z(f))

A mechanism is provided to associate a derivative with a user-defined expression (or more generally to override automatic differentiation): if a variable named <q>D_&lt;svname&gt;_&lt;vname&gt;</q> is declared, it will be preferentially used as the value of the derivative of variable &lt;vname&gt; with respect to variable &lt;svname&gt; wherever needed. If no such variable is declared and &lt;vname&gt; was previously defined as a symbolic expression, its derivative will be automatically generated. If &lt;vname&gt; is undefined, an error will result. If &lt;vname&gt; was declared as an ordinary CPL VARIABLE (or CONSTANT) rather than as a symbolic expression, it will be treated as a constant whose derivative is zero.

As a side effect, variable names starting with <q>D_</q> are reserved and should not be defined for other purposes when symbolic.cpl is in USE.
