    <h1>Download CPL</h1>
    <p>The CPL tools come in a self-extracting archive, which you can download at the bottom of this page. The archive unpacks to its own directory in user space and requires no privileges.
    <h2>System requirements</h2>
    <p>The CPL compiler and interpreter run on Linux/unix systems. They were developed on <a href="https://www.debian.org" target=_blank>Debian GNU/Linux</a>, and this is the system where most tests were performed. Nonetheless the tools and the way they are packed are not tied to a specific flavour of Linux or unix nor to a specific processor architecture; any of the widespread Linux/unix distributions on either personal or datacenter systems should unpack and use them equally well, and all those tested did. The tools have also been successfully deployed in <a href="https://raspberrypi.org" target=_blank>Raspberry Pi</a> and <a href="https://www.element14.com/community/docs/DOC-84108/l/beaglebone-black-development-board-with-1ghz-am335x-arm-cortex-a8-processor" target=_blank>Beaglebone Black</a> ARM-based microboards, as well as in non-Linux unices such as older Silicon Graphics machines and BSD systems including Apple Macintosh computers, for which step-by-step instruction are provided in <a href="macOS-howto.html">this Macintosh howto</a>. And the <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wsl/about" target=_blank>Windows Subsystem for Linux (WSL)</a>, which is an integral part of Microsoft Windows 10, essentially <em>is</em> Debian GNU/Linux (except for its graphical user interface); step-by-step instructions are provided in <a href="Windows-howto.html">this Windows howto</a>.</p>
    <p>Only basic system tools are required: gzip, tar, cc, make, info, plus <a href="https://sourceforge.net/projects/gnuplot/" target=_blank>gnuplot</a> if you want graphics and <a href="https://curl.se">curl</a> for optional automatic updates. For maximal compatibility the adopted C compiler should be <a href="https://gcc.gnu.org" target=_blank>gcc</a> (as the system compiler is by default in most Linux distributions), but other compilers (e.g. <a href="https://software.intel.com/content/www/us/en/develop/tools/oneapi/components/dpc-compiler.html" target=_blank>icc</a>) have also been used with success. However, CPL <a href="Documentation/cpl.html#nested%20functions">nested functions</a> are implemented as C nested functions, a nonstandard gcc extension, and will become unavailable if a compiler other than gcc is used (or if the system's default gcc options disable them).</p>

    <h2>Storage requirements</h2>
    <p>Minimal by any standard. The uncompressed archive, inclusive of documentation and libraries, altogether takes about 1.5 megabytes (0.0015 GB).</p>

    <h2>Compilation time requirements</h2>
    <p>Generally a small fraction of the, already very reasonable, time taken by the subsequently invoked C compiler.</p>

    <h2>Code maturity</h2>
    <p>CPL is under active development; its tools sit at different levels of maturity. On a crude scale:</p>
    <table>
    <tr><td class=circle style="background-color:green"></td> <td><a href="Documentation/cpl.html#cpl"><code>cpl</code></a>, <a href="Documentation/fri.html#Top"><code>fri</code></a>, and their driver script <a href="Documentation/cpl.html#makecpl"><code>makecpl</code></a> were being developed for decades. They now only undergo unfrequent changes.</td></tr>
    <tr><td class=circle style="background-color:gold"></td> <td><a href="Documentation/cpl.html#icpl"><code>icpl</code></a> is best classified as experimental. Don't be surprised if it does not always behave as intended, but it offers some powerful features when it does.</td></tr>
    <tr><td class=circle style="background-color:orange"></td> <td><a href="Documentation/editor.html#full-screen"><code>edit</code></a> is the newest addition to the family. It may on rare occasions crash and lose your last edits, so be advised to save often (as everybody should do anyway). Nevertheless it is the editor of choice for the maintenance of CPL itself, writing this website included.</td></tr>
    </table>
    <p> On a finer scale, the optional CPL <a href="Documentation/cpl.html#Library">libraries</a> provided in the package also come with different levels of maturity. See comments in each.</p>
    <p>Mature or not as the code is, bugs will happen. If you believe you found a bug, or an inconsistency between the compiler's behaviour and its documentation, you will do an appreciable service to the CPL community by filing a bug report with <img src="images/bugreports.png" class=em alt="(.....)"> . With your description please enclose a code snippet, as short as possible but complete enough that it compiles without modification and triggers the non-conforming behaviour.</p> 
    <p>Version updates are denoted by their date. File names in the version archive include dates. If you experience difficulties please see the Q&amp;A list of <a href="Documentation/cpl.html#Q%26A">common problems and their solutions</a>. </p>
