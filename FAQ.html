  <div itemscope itemprop="mainEntity" itemtype="https://schema.org/Question">
    <h2 itemprop="name">Does your programming language use brackets like in Mathematics?</h2>
    <div itemscope itemprop="acceptedAnswer" itemtype="https://schema.org/Answer">
      <div itemprop="text">
      Brackets, or braces, are a syntactic construct in many programming languages. They are typically assigned different semantic meanings. In the C language parentheses or round brackets () are used to group arithmetic expressions or function arguments, square brackets [] are used for array subscripting, and braces or curly brackets {} delimit compound statements or definitions.<br>
      <p><a href="https://CPLcode.net">CPL</a> uses brackets just as you were taught in school. All three kinds of round, square, and curly <a href="https://CPLcode.net/Documentation/cpl.html#Parentheses">brackets</a> are interchangeably available for grouping arithmetic expressions or any other of the above usages, but each must be matched by its own kind. To alternate parentheses, brackets and braces, though optional, is beneficial to the human eye's reading and proofreading nested formulas and enhances automatic error catching.</p>
      <p>The provided <a href="https://CPLcode.net/Documentation/editor.html#full-screen">code editor</a> can automatically alternate bracket styles and match bracket pairs for you.</p>

  <div itemscope itemprop="mainEntity" itemtype="https://schema.org/Question">
    <h2 itemprop="name">Is this an object-oriented language?</h2>
    <div itemscope itemprop="acceptedAnswer" itemtype="https://schema.org/Answer">
      <div itemprop="text">
An object-oriented language (OOL) implements objects and their associated procedures within the software programming context, and encourages reuse of these objects within the same and other programs. Java, C++ and Smalltalk are popular examples of object-oriented languages. They typically bind related data and functions into a <q>class</q> object.<br>
<p><a href="https://CPLcode.net">CPL</a> supports the object paradigm but avoids the inclusion of function definitions inside classes in favour of <a href="https://CPLcode.net/Documentation/cpl.html#Coactive-Parameter-Lists">overloaded, polymorphic functions</a> that are qualified by the (oftentimes <a href="https://CPLcode.net/Documentation/cpl.html#STRUCTURE">STRUCTURE</a>) type of one or more of their arguments. It caters for subtyping and inheritance through <a href="https://CPLcode.net/Documentation/cpl.html#anonymous">anonymous</a> STRUCTURE fields, and for dynamically typed objects through <a href="https://CPLcode.net/Documentation/cpl.html#DYNAMIC">DYNAMIC</a> pointers.</p>

  <div itemscope itemprop="mainEntity" itemtype="https://schema.org/Question">
    <h2 itemprop="name">Where must a function prototype be declared?</h2>
    <div itemscope itemprop="acceptedAnswer" itemtype="https://schema.org/Answer">
      <div itemprop="text">
      Function prototypes exist in most languages and allow many programming errors to be caught at compile time. They are also essential to disambiguating overloaded functions. However, prototype checking in C and FORTRAN and many other compiled languages requires dedicated <q>header</q> or <q>interface</q> files that inconveniently duplicate the definitions contained in the program proper.<br>
      <p><a href="https://CPLcode.net">CPL</a> checks prototype coherence by polling the <a href="https://CPLcode.net/Documentation/cpl.html#USE">USEd</a> files in stead of headers, and issues compile-time errors accordingly. The prototype-enforcing process is totally transparent to the user who no longer needs to write separate header files (but may if one wants to).</p>

  <div itemscope itemprop="mainEntity" itemtype="https://schema.org/Question">
    <h2 itemprop="name">Do you offer symbolic manipulation?</h2>
    <div itemscope itemprop="acceptedAnswer" itemtype="https://schema.org/Answer">
      <div itemprop="text">
The <a href="https://CPLcode.net/Documentation/symbolic.html#Top">symbolic.cpl</a> library provides symbolic differentiation capabilities.
<!--
Symbolic differentiation is seamlessly integrated in the compiler, and is
performed at compile time: any desired symbolic derivatives are worked out
during compilation, and inlined in the generated code.

  <div itemscope itemprop="mainEntity" itemtype="https://schema.org/Question">
    <h2 itemprop="name">Can CPL work backwards through a numerical code to calculate the derivative of some stated objective with respect to certain inputs of a problem (so called <q>automatic differentiation</q>)?</h2>
    <div itemscope itemprop="acceptedAnswer" itemtype="https://schema.org/Answer">
      <div itemprop="text">
-->
Not only can <a href="https://CPLcode.net">CPL</a> work backwards through a chain of expressions to calculate a symbolic derivative (<a itemscope itemtype="http://schema.org/Article http://schema.org/ScholarlyArticle" href='http://dx.doi.org/10.1146/annurev-fluid-010313-141253'>discrete adjoint</a>), but it does so transparently during compilation, without the user needing to even see the intermediate code generated by automatic differentiation.<br>
<p>In numerical optimization problems, once the expression of an objective function is programmed in the code, its derivative with respect to either a scalar parameter or an array element can be denoted symbolically just as one would on paper.</p>

    <div itemscope itemprop="acceptedAnswer" itemtype="https://schema.org/Answer">
      <div itemprop="text">
The <a href="https://CPLcode.net">CPL</a> compiler's most distinctive feature is its incremental extensibility. The <a href="https://CPLcode.net/Documentation/cpl.html#Library">included libraries</a> provide <a href="https://CPLcode.net/Documentation/matrix.html#Top">matrix operations</a>, <a href="https://CPLcode.net/Documentation/graphics.html#Top">gnuplot graphics</a>, and <a href="https://CPLcode.net/Documentation/symbolic.html#Top">symbolic manipulation</a>, among other extensions, all blended into the <a href="https://CPLcode.net/Documentation/cpl.html#Syntax">language syntax</a>.<br>

      <div itemprop="text">
The <a href="https://CPLcode.net">CPL</a> compiler can read and make sense of a C header file.

      <div itemprop="text">
      <a href="https://CPLcode.net">CPL</a> <a href="https://CPLcode.net/Documentation/cpl.html#ARRAY">arrays</a> allow variable (<i>i.e.</i>, run-time specified) and independent lower and upper bounds of each index wherever they allow constant ones; the compiler

    <h2 itemprop="name">Is your programming language compiled?</h2>
    <div itemscope itemprop="acceptedAnswer" itemtype="https://schema.org/Answer">
      <div itemprop="text">
        <a href="https://CPLcode.net">CPL</a> was conceived as a compiled language from the outset; when used for intensive computational tasks, it inherits the speed of compiled C. The basic <a href="https://CPLcode.net/Documentation/cpl.html#cpl">cpl make</a> command, used as
  <pre>
  cpl make &lt;program&gt;[.cpl] [&lt;option&gt;]</pre>
  is all that is needed to compile and link the source file
  &lt;program&gt;.cpl into the executable file &lt;program&gt;, which you can then run

  <div itemscope itemprop="mainEntity" itemtype="https://schema.org/Question">
    <h2 itemprop="name">Can a CPL program be just run, like in a scripting language?</h2>
    <div itemscope itemprop="acceptedAnswer" itemtype="https://schema.org/Answer">
      <div itemprop="text">
A scripting language or script language is a programming language that is usually interpreted at run time rather than compiled. In general, scripting languages are easier to learn and faster to code in than more structured and compiled languages such as C and C++.<br>
<p>Although <a href="https://CPLcode.net">CPL</a> <i>is</i> compiled, the straight
  <a href="https://CPLcode.net/Documentation/cpl.html#cpl-run">cpl run</a> command makes it act just like a scripting language, by directly running a plain-text CPL source file while transparently compiling it when and only when it detects a modification.</p>
  <p>If invoked from a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shebang_(Unix)">shebang</a>, <a href="https://CPLcode.net/Documentation/cpl.html#cpl-run">cpl run</a> makes <a href="https://CPLcode.net">CPL</a> code executable as a script, but at compiled-code speed.</p>

      <div itemprop="text">
  The <a href="https://CPLcode.net/Documentation/cpl.html#cpl-i">interactive CPL interpreter</a> accepts expressions, statements or commands at a console prompt. Any <a href="https://CPLcode.net/Documentation/cpl.html#Top">CPL</a> or <a href="https://CPLcode.net/Documentation/cpl.html#C-interface">C</a> or <a href="https://CPLcode.net/Documentation/cpl.html#FORTRAN-interface">FORTRAN</a> library can be loaded into the interpreter and have its functions invoked from the command prompt, either alone or embedded in a greater CPL command or expression.

      <div itemprop="text">
  <a href="https://CPLcode.net">CPL</a> includes a <a href="https://CPLcode.net/Documentation/editor.html#Top">text editor</a> for program development, equipped with word and syntax completion at the touch of the Tab key. <a href="https://CPLcode.net/Documentation/cpl.html#cpl-i">Interactive cpl</a> and the <a href="https://CPLcode.net/Documentation/editor.html#Top">editor</a> in fact comprise a single integrated development environment: its command-console and editor faces can be switched at the touch of a key.

  a smartphone's ssh client if in a pinch one feels the need for it.

    <h2 itemprop="name">Is CPL a good alternative to FORTRAN and C for high performance computing?</h2>
    <div itemscope itemprop="acceptedAnswer" itemtype="https://schema.org/Answer">
      <div itemprop="text">
  <a href="https://CPLcode.net">CPL</a> provides the same computational performance as FORTRAN or C (it eventually delegates low-level optimization to the system's C compiler, while all of its own constructions are carefully crafted not to interfere with such optimization), but adds a higher-level <a href="https://CPLcode.net/Documentation/cpl.html#Syntax">syntax</a> and is generally more compact and intuitive to use. CPL enforces function prototypes without needing header or interface files. Both <a href="https://CPLcode.net/Documentation/cpl.html#mpicpl">MPI</a> and <a href="https://CPLcode.net/Documentation/cpl.html#OpenMP">OpenMP</a> parallelizations are catered for, as well as CPL's own <a href="https://CPLcode.net/Documentation/cpl.html#parallel">parallel</a> module. Third-party <a href="https://CPLcode.net/Documentation/cpl.html#FORTRAN-interface">FORTRAN</a> and <a href="https://CPLcode.net/Documentation/cpl.html#C-interface">C</a> libraries (say LAPACK, for instance) are easily integrated into <a href="https://CPLcode.net">CPL</a> programs.

  <div itemscope itemprop="mainEntity" itemtype="https://schema.org/Question">
    <h2 itemprop="name">Does this programming language have pointers?</h2>
    <div itemscope itemprop="acceptedAnswer" itemtype="https://schema.org/Answer">
      <div itemprop="text">
      C and FORTRAN have a diametrically opposite approach to pointers (variables that contain the memory address of other variables). Pointers sit at the very foundation of the C language, with the intended purpose to maximize efficiency through a close correspondence to machine language, but with the drawback of a somewhat unwieldy notation sprinkled all over with &lowast;'s and &amp;'s. Pointer declarations decide whether a function argument is passed by value or by reference. Arithmetics is allowed on pointers, with greatest flexibility but also vulnerability to programming errors. The original FORTRAN 77 on the other hand banned pointers entirely, passing function arguments by reference only and forcing the programmer to replace pointers with array indices even when this sounded unnatural, as in linked lists for example; subsequent versions of FORTRAN introduced pointers of a restricted nature, with no pointer arithmetics, but widely available FORTRAN libraries still rarely use pointers.<br>
      <p><a href="https://CPLcode.net">CPL</a> treads a middle ground by making C-like use of <a href="https://CPLcode.net/Documentation/cpl.html#POINTER">pointers</a> possible, but concealing the near totality of referencing and dereferencing operations under <a href="https://CPLcode.net/Documentation/cpl.html#Concealed-Pointer-Lookup">implicit type conversion</a>. Pointer <i>declarations</i> decide whether a function argument is passed by value or by reference, but no special notation has to be used in function <i>calls</i>. <a href="https://CPLcode.net/Documentation/cpl.html#INTO">Pointer arithmetics</a> is allowed but restricted to the allocated memory space of a single compound variable, and confined to stay there when <a href="https://CPLcode.net/Documentation/cpl.html#rtchecks">run-time error checking</a> is on.</p>

  <div itemscope itemprop="mainEntity" itemtype="https://schema.org/Question">
    <h2 itemprop="name">Is CPL a good alternative to C++ for writing reusable code?</h2>
    <div itemscope itemprop="acceptedAnswer" itemtype="https://schema.org/Answer">
      <div itemprop="text">
   Code reusability may generally denote a careful programming style with meaningful identifiers and recognizable constructions, something which is to advise in any language; in the context of object-oriented programming, it specifically denotes the reuse of properties of a base class in the derived classes. <a href="https://CPLcode.net">CPL</a>'s <q>classes</q> only contain data and not functions, and are therefore ordinary <a href="https://CPLcode.net/Documentation/cpl.html#STRUCTURE">STRUCTUREs</a>. The key to their reusability is in that derived <a href="https://CPLcode.net/Documentation/cpl.html#STRUCTURE">STRUCTUREs</a>, containing the data fields of a base type plus their own, can be implicitly converted to their base type. All CPL <a href="https://CPLcode.net/Documentation/cpl.html#FUNCTION">functions</a> are <a href="https://CPLcode.net/Documentation/cpl.html#Coactive-Parameter-Lists">polymorphic</a> and coactivated by the type of their arguments, and therefore functions declared with the base type as argument can automatically be reused on the derived type without modification (or just their name can be reused to declare a more specific function, as one sees fit). Since functions do not belong to a single class, reusability can be applied to more than one argument, possibly at the same time. When only the first argument is involved, a C++-like dot notation is available to be used where it sounds more adapt to the application.
