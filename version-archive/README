versions predating this website lack a LICENSE file and are provided under the general LICENSE.txt included in this directory. They are here for documentation and for the benefit of users who already used CPL before this website was set up. As gcc default options have changed over time, older versions may require compiler options or a contemporary gcc. New users will only ever want the most recent version, accessible as unpack-cpl.sh
