    <h1>Download CPL</h1>
    The CPL tools come in the form of a self-extracting archive, which you can download at the bottom of this page. Installation in user space requires no privileges. To install, run the downloaded file in a terminal as <strong>"<code>sh install-cpl.sh</code>" and follow the instructions on screen</strong>.</p>
    <h2>System requirements</h2>
    <p>The CPL compiler and interpreter run on Linux/unix systems. They have been developed on <a href="https://www.debian.org" target=_blank>Debian GNU/Linux</a>, and this is the primary system suggested for their usage. Nevertheless, the installation is not tied to a specific flavour of Linux or unix nor to a specific processor architecture. Although incompatibilities can arise from variations in the system C library (your mileage may vary), installation has been successful in some versions of the <a href="https://apps.apple.com/app/xcode/id497799835?mt=12" target=_blank>MacOS Xcode</a> environment, as well as in <a href="https://raspberrypi.org" target=_blank>Raspberry Pi</a> and <a href="https://www.element14.com/community/docs/DOC-84108/l/beaglebone-black-development-board-with-1ghz-am335x-arm-cortex-a8-processor" target=_blank>Beaglebone Black</a> ARM-based microboards. And the <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wsl/about target=_blank">Windows Subsystem for Linux (WSL)</a>, which is an integral part of Windows 10, essentially <em>is</em> Debian GNU/Linux.</p> 
    <p>Only basic system tools are required: gzip, tar, cc, make, info, plus <a href="https://sourceforge.net/projects/gnuplot/" target=_blank>gnuplot</a> if you want graphics. For maximal compatibility the system compiler should be <a href="https://gcc.gnu.org" target=_blank>gcc</a> (as it is by default in Debian), but other compilers (e.g. <a href="https://software.intel.com/content/www/us/en/develop/tools/oneapi/components/dpc-compiler.html" target=_blank>icc</a>) have also been used. However, CPL <a href="Documentation/cpl.html#Nested%20functions">nested functions</a> are implemented as C nested functions, a nonstandard gcc extension, and will become unavailable if a compiler other than gcc is used (or if the system's gcc disables them).</p>

    <h2>Code maturity</h2>
    <p>CPL is under active development; its portions sit at different levels of maturity. On a crude scale:</p>
    <table>
    <tr><td class=dot style="background-color:green"></td> <td><a href="Documentation/cpl.html#makecpl" target=_blank><code>makecpl</code></a> has been under development for decades. It now only undergoes unfrequent changes.</td></tr>
    <tr><td class=dot style="background-color:gold"></td> <td><a href="Documentation/cpl.html#icpl" target=_blank><code>icpl</code></a> is best classified as experimental. Don't be surprised if it does not always behave as intended, but it can be very useful when it does.</td></tr>
    <tr><td class=dot style="background-color:red"></td> <td><a href="Documentation/readline.html#full-screen" target=_blank><code>edit</code></a> is even younger. It may on rare occasions crash and lose your edits, so be warned to save often (as everybody should do anyway). Nevertheless it is the editor of choice for the maintenance of CPL itself, writing this website included.</td></tr>
    </table>
    <p> On a finer scale, the optional CPL libraries provided in the package also come with different levels of maturity. See comments in each.</p>
    <p>Mature or not, bugs will happen. If you believe you found a bug, or an inconsistency between the compiler's behaviour and its documentation, you will do an appreciable service to the CPL community by filing a bug report with <img src="bugreports.png" style="height:0.9em;vertical-align:bottom" alt="(.....)"> With your description please enclose a code snippet, as short as possible but complete enough that it actually compiles and triggers the non-conforming behaviour.</p> 
    <p>Version updates are denoted by their date. File names in the version archive include dates.</p>
