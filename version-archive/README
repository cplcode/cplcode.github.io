Older versions that lack a LICENSE file are provided for documentation only and for the benefit of users who already used CPL before this website was set up. As gcc default options have changed over time, older makecpl versions may require explicit compiler options or a contemporary gcc. The current version is always accessible as unpack-cpl.sh
