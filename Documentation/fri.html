<hr> <h3>FRI architecture</h3>
FRI is a declarative language. The FRI virtual machine's workspace is composed of three items: an input character stream, an output character stream and a dictionary of rules. A rule is a sequence of bytes that can represent characters to be matched against the input stream, characters to be written to the output stream, or opcodes specifying general actions that can modify either stream, or the dictionary itself, or initiate a new rule. A rule <q>matches</q> if it runs to its end, or <q>fails</q> if an input character or an inner nested rule does not match.

FRI's alphabet is restricted to 7-bit ascii, and bytes with the 8th bit set, when they appear in the dictionary amidst the characters to be recognized, are given the meaning of opcodes specifying a variety of operations.

The input stream is generally attached to an input file to be manipulated, but can also be modified by explicit instructions (opcodes). The output stream is not automatically attached to a file and must be written out explicitly when desired. It is internally subdivided into a stack of strings which can be individually recalled. Every time a rule matches, all but its top output strings are forgotten while its top string is returned to the calling rule (either appended to its output or prepended to its input).

The dictionary of rules is alphabetically ordered and, with one exception, independent of the order in which the rules are entered. Each new rule inserted in the dictionary gets assigned to a progressively numbered <q>scope</q>. A new scope can be opened at any time by an explicit command and will contain subsequently generated rules, all of which disappear when the scope is eventually closed. A certain number of opcodes with no action are reserved as <q>strands</q>, markers of rules with related meaning. Each rule must start with a strand opcode, but strand opcodes can also appear elsewhere with a user- assigned meaning. If a rule, or more accurately a strand of alternate rules, is viewed as a sort of subroutine, this subroutine can be <q>called</q> by inserting its strand byte in the input stream.

When one rule fails, execution restarts with the next one in the dictionary. If two rules have a common root, only the part of the rule that failed undergoes a new attempt; side effects of the part that matched will not be repeated more than once. Execution terminates, as a match, when any one rule's byte sequence attains its end (or an explicit end opcode) or, as a failure, when the dictionary runs out of rules. For debugging purposes, it can also be terminated in an error message by suitable opcodes.

<hr> <h3>Language opcodes</h3>
Character matching

Symbol        pronounced  action
 ascii char        any 7-bit ascii character matches itself.
 --         except        matches if the following character does not match the input.
 -      through  matches if the input is not alphabetically enclosed (in ascii
                 order) between the next two characters, excluded.
 ]=        cork        (coded as ascii char 127) automatically added to the input
                stream every time new input is provided; like all ascii
                characters, matches itself.
 {        {        (ascii code 18) if found in the input stream, groups a block of
                zero or more characters up to the next } (ascii code 19) for
                copying purposes. Can be nested. Like all ascii characters,
                matches itself.
 copy        copy        copies one (non-cork) character or one {}-enclosed block from
                the input to the output stream.
 *   copy up to        copies zero or more characters or {}-enclosed blocks from
                the input to the output stream until the following character
                (or a cork) is encountered. The matching character is popped
                from the input stream but not written out.

Character writing

 =[        put        opens a new string in the output stack and switches from input
                to output mode, which will last until the next unescaped opcode
                starting with a ], -&gt; or *.
 ascii char        in output mode an ascii character is just written; even opcodes
                are written rather than executed, with the exception of the
                above output terminators, which restore input mode and are then
                executed, and #, ^, delete, UniqueNo, LineNo which are executed
                without leaving output mode.
 ^        escape        the character following an escape is written to the output
                stream unconditionally, in either mode and even if it is an
                opcode. A sequence of $n$ escapes is written as a sequence of
                $n-1$ escapes plus the following character, except if the
                following character is a null (ascii 0) which is not written.
 #        number        recalls an output string identified by the number that follows,
                and appends it to the current output. It can be followed by a
                positive number, denoting a stack count backwards from the top,
                a negative number, denoting a stack count backwards from the
                first string of the present rule, or a symbolic label assigned
                by the @ pseudocode.
 @        label        an assembler pseudo-opcode that assigns the following alpha-
                numeric string as a label to the current position in the output
                stack, so it can later be recalled (within the same rule only)
                by name.
 ]        end        exits output mode or the current control sequence or the
                current rule.
 ]=        cork        exits output mode and adjoins the top two output strings,
                decreasing the stack count by one.
 backspace backspace  drops the top string from the output stack.

Flow control

 -&gt;  pipe into        pops the top output string and prepends it as a new input
                extent to the current input, separated by a ]= (cork) byte. The
                new input shall either be passed as such to the rest of the
                rule, if it starts with a 7-bit ascii character, or be
                processed by a new instance of the rule-matching virtual
                machine if it starts with an opcode. After the called-up rule
                matches, its output becomes the new input and the calling rule
                continues, but in case of a later failure the rule-matching
                machine is invoked again and again until a match is obtained or
                no more rules are available.
 convert        convert null opcode, matches itself and returns what follows in its
                input extent. Typically used before another opcode in a -&gt;
                (pipe into) operation, in order for its contents to get a
                chance to be examined as input by the rest of the rule before
                being ``converted'' by a new rule-matching passage.
 ]        end        successfully terminates the current rule, the output mode, or
                any of the compound sub-rules described below.
 1[    optional  executes the enclosed subrule (up to a matching <q>]</q>) 0 or 1
                times, reporting success to the containing rule.
 [        repeat        repeats the enclosed subrule (up to a matching <q>]</q>) 0 or more
                times until it fails, reporting success to the containing rule
                and adjoining each output to the output stream.
 r[        recur        repeats the enclosed subrule (up to a matching <q>]</q>) 0 or more
                times until it fails, reporting success to the containing rule
                and replacing the output stream by each output.
 ifnot[        if not        succeeds if the enclosed rule fails, and fails if the enclosed
                subrule (up to a closing <q>]</q>) matches, discarding its output.
 until[        until        succeeds if the enclosed rule fails and fails if the enclosed
                subrule (up to a closing <q>]</q>) matches, saving its output in the
                output stream.
 #        number        when used in input mode, recalls a string from the output stack
                (by the same numbering scheme as in output mode), and executes
                it as a string of bytecodes, as if they appeared at the current
                position in the current        rule.
 cut        cut        like the Prolog ``cut'', asserts that failure beyond its
                position is not intended to occur. If the present rule fails
                after a cut, an error will be reported rather than moving on to
                the next rule. In addition, cut has lower priority than all
                other opcodes except ], so if two rules are identical up to
                where a cut appears, the cut rule will be tried last.

 Dictionary manipulation

 ]-&gt;        save        saves the top output string to the dictionary as a new rule, in
                the same scope as rules starting with the following opcode, or
                in the current scope if the following character is null.
 openscope open scope  opens a new scope.
 closescope close scope        closes the current scope and erases all rules generated
                since the last openscope.
 delete        delete        deletes from the dictionary all rules that start with the byte
                sequence contained in the top output string and belong in the
                current scope.

File handling

 open        open        opens a file for output, taking its name from the top output
                string.
 close        close        closes the current output file, resuming output to the
                previously open one.
 ]-&gt;out write out  writes the top output string to the current output file and
                pops it off the output stack.
 include        include  opens a file for input, taking its name from the top output
                string, and includes it at the current position in the input
                stream, followed by a ]= (cork). At the end of this file the
                file will be closed and the previous input will resume
                automatically.
 closein        close input  forces closing the current input file, resuming input from
                where it was in the previously opened one.

Shortcut opcodes

 spaces        spaces        matches a sequence of zero or more blank characters (spaces and
                tabs).
 *]=  copy all   copies all remaining characters from the last input extent to
                the output stream, reading but not copying the next cork.
                Nearly equivalent to * ]=, but notice that the boundary of an
                input extent is internally marked, so *]= will copy all of it
                even if it contains an internal ]=} (cork).
 =[]  put end        opens an empty new string in the output stack and goes back to
                input mode; single opcode equivalent to =[ ].
 do        do        starts execution of the rule that begins with the next bytecode
                in a new virtual machine; replaces a single-byte -&gt; (pipe).
 ]&gt;        append        appends the top output string to the rule that starts with the
                following bytecode. Useful for the temporary storage of
                arbitrary strings.
 get        get        a do (do) replacement that only executes a rule composed of a
                single =[ (put), presumably created by a sequence of ]&gt;
                (append) operations, and deletes the rule at the same time. It
                does its job by reference, which for long strings speeds up
                execution.

Debugging

 ]-&gt;error cast error  writes the top output string to stderr and terminates
                execution in error.
 trace        trace        toggles in and out of tracing mode, where an interactive
                animation of the rule-matching process is displayed on the
                controlling terminal.
 LineNo line number  writes the current input-file line number to the output
                stream.
 list-&gt;        list        extracts from the dictionary all the rules that start by the
                byte sequence provided in the top output string, and prepends
                them to the input one after the other, each one as a new input
                extent separated by a ]= (cork), with an empty input extent
                terminating the whole list.
 wrsym write symbol  converts the opcode provided in the top output character to
                its symbolic name.
 display display  displays the top output string on the controlling terminal.

Miscellaneous, less frequently used operations

 ## scope number  only valid in output mode, recalls the current scope
                identifier so it can later be used in a ]-&gt; (save) operation.
 =&gt; force write  appends everything that follows to the output stream in an
                8-bit safe way, including any opcodes that might terminate a
                normal =[ (put).
 AssignStrand assign strand  decrements an internal counter and outputs the next
                available still unused null opcode (deputed as a rule strand).
 UniqueNo unique number  increments and outputs (in decimal ascii) the
                internal Unique Number counter, made available in order to
                assign unambiguous identifiers to variables.
 pushNo push number  pushes the value of the Unique Number counter (as a binary
                integer) onto the output stream.
 popNo pop number  pops the value of the Unique Number counter (as a binary
                integer) from the output stream.
 writeimage write image  writes a binary image of the whole dictionary to the
                output file (so it can later be quickly reloaded rather re-
                translated).
 readimage read image  reads in a binary dictionary image prepared by
                writeimage.
 younger        younger  matches if the current input file is younger (has a more
                recent modification time) than the file named in the top output
                string, or the latter does not exist.
 wrinputpos write input position  writes the input-stream position pointer (as a
                binary sequence of bytes) to the output stream.
 rdinputpos read input position  pops the input-stream position pointer (as a
                binary sequence of bytes) from the output stream, effectively
                resuming input from where it was when wrinputpos was invoked.
 cpinputpos copy input position  outputs the input-stream chunk going from the
                position previously marked by wrinputpos to the current input
                position.
 ascii        ascii        outputs the character whose ascii code appears in hexadecimal
                notation in the next two input characters.
 shell command shell command  passes the top output string to the operating-
                system shell for execution as a command.

<hr> <h3>The fri command line</h3>
Usage:              fri [rule file] [-e command] [-i] [data file] ...

All arguments are optional. fri called with no arguments displays its copyright and version message and exits.

The rule file contains a list of FRI definitions and optionally a -e clause. It can also redefine the syntax of the command line itself, as for instance the CPL compiler does, in which case no -e clause need appear. An initial line beginning with # is ignored, and allows the rule file to be made executable in a unix shell by declaring fri as its interpreter.

If the -e clause appears either inside the rule file or on the command line, the remaining parameters are interpreted as data files to act upon. A file name of - stands for stdin. If no data files are listed, input is taken from stdin.

The command specified in FRI syntax by the -e clause is executed in a loop until the end of file, copying one character from input to output every time the command fails. The command that succeeds may consume one or more or even all characters.

If the -i option is present, each data file is overwritten in place; otherwise each file is acted upon in a sequence and its result catenated to stdout.

EXAMPLES

cat replacement:
        fri -e copy

tac replacement:
        fri -e 'r[ =[ * \n =[\n #2]=]'

substitute apples for oranges:
        fri -e '<q>orange</q> =[<q>apple</q>]'
