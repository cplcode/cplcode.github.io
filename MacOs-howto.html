    <h2>CPL-on-Macintosh howto</h2>
    <p>The Apple Macintosh proprietary operating system (MacOs or OSX) is built on top of publicly available BSD unix. It therefore has all the characteristics for CPL tools and programs to run on it natively. However, the classical unix programming tools are not part of the base operating system, but are provided by Apple as a separate Xcode development environment. In addition, although Xcode includes a compiler named <code>gcc</code>, this is an Apple-modified version (also known as <code>clang</code>) and lacks some gcc extensions used by CPL. Unmodified <code>gcc</code> can be installed through a third-party package manager such as <a href="http://brew,sh">Homebrew</a>. Hence the following</p>
    Step by step instructions to use CPL on Apple MacOs.
    <p>(partly modelled after <a href="https://osxdaily.com/2014/02/12/install-command-line-tools-mac-os-x/">https://osxdaily.com/2014/02/12/install-command-line-tools-mac-os-x/</a>)</p>
    <dl>
    <dt>1 - Open a terminal:.</dt>
    <dd> If you do not already have the terminal icon in your taskbar, write <q>terminal</q> in the search box and click <q>terminal.app</q>.</dd>
    <dt>2 - Install Command Line Tools:</dt>
    <dd>Enter <pre>xcode-select --install</pre> A dialog box will pop up asking if you want to install the Command Line Developer Tools. Accept. If the box does not appear, you probably have them already. Do not install the (much larger) Xcode development environment (available for free in the Apple shop) unless you want it for other purposes.</dd>
    <dt>3 - Install the Homebrew package manager:</dt>
    <dd>Follow instructions on the <a href="brew.sh">brew.sh</a> website.</dd>
    <dt>4 - Install original gcc (the one provided by Apple is an alias for their own clang):</dt>
    <dd><pre>brew install gcc</pre>
    </dd>
    <dt>5 - Unpack the CPL archive you previously downloaded, with the <code>CC</code> environment variable pointing at the brew-installed C compiler (currently named <code>gcc-10</code>):</dt>
    <dd><pre>CC=gcc-10 sh Downloads/*cpl.sh</em></pre>
    </dd>
    <dt>6 - To activate CPL graphics, install gnuplot:</dt>
    <dd><pre>brew install gnuplot</pre>
    </dd>
    </dl>
    <p>You are all set!</p>
