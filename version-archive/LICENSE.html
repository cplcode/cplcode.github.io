This software includes a compiler intended to translate source code provided by
the user into intermediate source code that will be fed to a further compiler.
A distinction is therefore needed between 1) software generated by this
software; 2) additional software (such as a further compiler) that is activated
by this software; and 3) this software. In the present text, "this software"
denotes the set of files accompanied by this license at the time of release.

1) The stream of characters spread over several files output by this software,
in its part deriving from the translation or the interpretation of original
input supplied by the user, is hereby assigned to the full property and
responsibility of the owner of the input, with no express or implied warranty
and no assurance that it actually is source code suitable for any purpose and
it will not harm the computer or its other software. In addition the user is
granted a nonexclusive right to the remaining part of the output, originating
from the inclusion or the translation of libraries provided in this software,
to all applicable extent except forbidding others from using similar code.

2) This software may automate the operation of additional, not included,
software tools, such as but not limited to a C compiler or a graphics program,
on behalf of the user. It is the user's exclusive responsibility to obtain such
additional software, to comply with its license, and to ensure that it is used
appropriately.

3) Permission to use, copy, and distribute this software and its documentation
for any purpose with or without fee is hereby granted, provided that the above
copyright notice appear in all copies and that both that copyright notice and
the full text of this license appear in supporting documentation.

Distribution of this software or portions of it in modified form is permitted
if the above conditions are met and in addition: changes are clearly marked and
attributed to their source; individually modified files, as well as the
package, are given names differing from the original and do not interfere with
their use. 

This software is provided "as is" without express or implied warranty to
the extent permitted by applicable law.
