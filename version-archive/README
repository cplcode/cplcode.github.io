versions predating this website lack a LICENSE file and are provided under the general LICENSE.txt included in this directory. They are here for documentation mainly and for the benefit of users who already used CPL before this website was set up. As gcc default options have changed over time, older versions may require explicit compiler options or a contemporary gcc. Most users will want the current version, always accessible as unpack-cpl.sh
