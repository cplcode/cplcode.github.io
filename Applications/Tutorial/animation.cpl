USE gnuplot
REAL g(-20..20,-20..20)
OPENGRAPH   ! open a clean graphics window 
set zrange [-1:1]   ! "set" commands are passed to gnuplot unchanged
! zrange must be set or it will change from one image to another
LOOP FOR t=0. TO 10000 BY 0.3   ! LOOP with a REAL index
  amp=SIN(t)
  DO g(ix,iy)=amp*EXP{-[(0.1*ix)^2+(0.1*iy)^2]/2} FOR ALL ix,iy
  ! notice optional use of alternating parentheses for clarity
  SPLOT g
