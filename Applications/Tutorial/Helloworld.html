<a href="cpl.html#WRITE">WRITE</a> "Hello world"

<span class=comment>! that's all, folks: a single-liner that doesn't require many explanations.</span>


<span class=comment>!( The program's beginning and end are marked by the beginning and end of the
  text itself. If "Hello world" (or "Hi there", or 2+2) is typed at the icpl
  console, even WRITE (but not quotes) may be omitted. !)</span>

<span class=comment>!( <span class=comment>! makes the rest of the line a comment. <span class=comment>!(...!)</span> bracket a multi-line or an</span>
  in-line comment. Comments can be nested. !)</span>

<span class=comment>![ If this is your first CPL program, download this (or any of the other
  examples) to a working directory in your computer, compile it with the
  command "makecpl Helloworld", then execute "Helloworld". !]</span>

<span class=comment>!{ As an alternative you can launch the "icpl" interactive shell in the
  directory where Helloworld.cpl resides and then enter "Helloworld".
  Just its name will both compile and execute this or any other program. !}</span>
