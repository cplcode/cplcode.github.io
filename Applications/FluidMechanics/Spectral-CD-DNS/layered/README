This is the parallel-by-layer implementation of scddns written for the Dilbert cluster in 1999-2000. Directory parallel contains the original implementation based on the parallel.cpl library (up to inessential reorganization to make it consistent with the other versions present on this website). An adaptation to OpenMP+MPI is in progress.
