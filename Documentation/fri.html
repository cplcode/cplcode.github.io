<hr> <h2>The FRI interpreter</h2>
The design of most compilers passes through a formal description of the language that is compiled by a parser generator like yacc into a C program. At the heart of CPL's extensibility there is a different structure, where a formal description of the language is never compiled to generate the compiler, but rather interpreted each time a compilation is run. The engine that does this is named fri, the Formal Rule Interpreter. If yacc is a compiler-compiler, fri may be called a compiler-interpreter.

In fact, fri is a quite general pattern-matching engine with its own FRI meta-language, and only <q>learns</q> about CPL when it reads the cpl file every time the compiler is invoked. Translators for many other languages can in principle be written in it. The interpreted nature of the CPL compiler, in addition to having allowed a smooth continued development and fine-tuning over the years, has the effect that its syntax can be extended on the fly by the compiled program itself with a few lines of FRI code written in a <a href="cpl.html#FRI-SECTION">(cpl)FRI SECTION</a>. This abilility is used by <a href="cpl.html#Library">(cpl)Library</a> modules in order to define, for instance, complex-number notation, matrix-algebra operations or symbolic manipulations.

<hr> <h3>FRI architecture</h3>
FRI is a declarative language. Much like a Turing machine, the FRI virtual machine's workspace is composed of three items: an input character stream, an output character stream and a dictionary of rules. A rule is a sequence of bytecodes that can represent characters to be matched against the input stream, characters to be written to the output stream, or opcodes specifying general actions that can modify either stream, or the dictionary itself, or initiate a new rule. A rule <q>matches</q> if it runs to its end, or <q>fails</q> if an input character or an inner nested rule does not match.

FRI's alphabet is restricted to 7-bit ascii, and bytes with the 8th bit set, when they appear in a rule amidst the characters to be recognized, are given the meaning of opcodes specifying a variety of operations.

The input stream is generally attached to an input file to be manipulated, but can also be modified by explicit instructions (opcodes). The output stream is not automatically attached to a file and must be written out explicitly when desired. It is internally subdivided into a stack of strings which can be individually recalled. Every time a rule matches, all but its top output string are forgotten while its top string is returned to the calling rule (either appended to its output or prepended to its input). When a rule fails, the input counter is reset to where it was when the rule began, and the output counter is reset so that all of its output strings are erased.

The dictionary of rules is alphabetically ordered and, with one exception, independent of the order in which the rules are entered. Additionally,  each new rule inserted in the dictionary gets assigned to a numbered <q>scope</q>. A new scope can be opened at any time by an explicit command and will contain subsequently generated rules, all of which disappear when the scope is eventually closed. A certain number of opcodes with no action are reserved as <q>strands</q>, markers of rules with related meaning. Each rule must start with a strand opcode, but strand opcodes can also appear elsewhere with a user assigned meaning. If a rule, or more accurately a strand of alternate rules, is viewed as a sort of subroutine, this subroutine can be <q>called</q> by inserting its strand byte in the input stream.

When one rule fails, execution restarts with the next one in the dictionary. If two rules have a common root, only the part of the rule that failed undergoes a new attempt; side effects of the part that matched will not be repeated more than once. Execution terminates, as a match, when any one rule's byte sequence attains its end (or an explicit end opcode) or, as a failure, when the dictionary runs out of rules. For debugging purposes, it can also be terminated in an error message by suitable opcodes.

<hr> <h3>The FRI assembler</h3>
Much like machine code of an actual CPU (into which fri might one day be implemented, perhaps), FRI bytecode is hard to type in by a human being. When fri boots up, the rule dictionary is initially filled with just enough rules to assemble human-readable FRI into FRI bytecode.

The FRI assembler uses symbolic names for <a href="#Opcodes">Opcodes</a>, listed below, and user-assigned names for strands. Additionally it provides the @ pseudo-opcode by which a stack element can be assigned a label and later referred to by this label rather than by its position on the stack.

The two strands FRIsymbol and FRIdefinition contain code for the assembler itself: at the basics FRIsymbol translates a symbolic name to its corresponding bytecode, and FRIdefinition assembles a sequence of FRIsymbol's into a rule and adds it to the dictionary. The assembler, like everything FRI, can modify its own rules, and frills and whistles are added this way.

A FRI assembler program is a text file with one FRI rule per line (and possible comments). The order of lines is largely irrelevant because they will be alphabetically sorted at the time they are inserted in the dictionary, with the exception that new FRIsymbol's and FRIdefinition's (like the definitions of strand names or of shortcuts) must come before they are used, and that rules that branch in output mode, after a =[ (put) opcode, are kept in last-to-first order. The branching-tree structure of the dictionary makes it so that, in rules having a common stem, the stem will be executed only once, even if one rule fails and the next one is tried. Branching is not allowed to split an output string even if the first few characters are coincident with another's, and will always occur at the =[ opcode that opens it. The last-to-first ordering allows a dynamically generated, more recent rule to temporarily override an older one, with the older rule automatically restored when the overriding one is deleted.

<hr> <h3>Language opcodes</h3>
FRI opcodes are represented by single bytes (with the 8th bit set), or in some cases by two bytes the first of which is a <q>shift</q> opcode, and in the assembler by symbolic names or punctuation symbols. The meaning of each symbolic name is described below, categorized according to function.

Character matching

Symbol	pronounced  action
 (ascii char)	any 7-bit ascii character matches itself.
 -- 	except	(followed by a single byte) matches if the following character
		does not match the input.
 -      through (followed by two bytes) matches if the input is not
		alphabetically enclosed (in ascii order) between the next two
		characters, excluded.
 ]=	cork	(coded as ascii char 127) automatically added to the input
		stream every time new input is inserted, to mark the end of the
		new input extent; like all ascii characters, matches itself.
 {	{	(ascii code 18) if found in the input stream, groups a block of
		zero or more characters up to the next } (ascii code 19) for
		copying purposes. Can be nested. Like all ascii characters,
		matches itself.
 copy	copy	copies one (non-cork) character or one {}-enclosed block from
		the input to the output stream.
 &lowast;   copy up to	(followed by a single byte) copies zero or more characters or
		{}-enclosed blocks from the input to the output stream until
		the following character (or a cork) is encountered. The
		terminating character is popped from the input stream but not
		written out.

Character writing

 =[	put	opens a new string in the output stack and switches from input
		to output mode, which will last until the next unescaped opcode
		starting with a ], -&gt; or &lowast;.
 (ascii char)	in output mode an ascii character is just written; even opcodes
		are written rather than executed, with the exception of the
		output terminators above, which restore input mode and are then
		executed, and #, ^, delete, UniqueNo, LineNo which are executed
		without leaving output mode.
 ^	escape	(followed by a single byte) the character following an escape
		is written to the output stream unconditionally, in either mode
		and even if it is an opcode. A sequence of $n$ escapes is
		written as a sequence of $n-1$ escapes plus the following
		character, except if the following character is a null
		(ascii 0) which is not written.
 #	number	(followed by a decimal digit or label) recalls an output
		string identified by the number that follows, and appends it to
		the current output. It can be followed by a positive number,
		denoting a stack count backwards from the top, a negative number,
		denoting a stack count backwards from the first string of the
		present rule, or a symbolic label assigned by the @ pseudocode.
 @	label	(followed by alphanumeric label) an assembler pseudo-opcode
		that assigns the following alphanumeric string as a label to
		the current position in the output stack, so it can later be
		recalled (within the same rule only) by name.
 ]	end	exits output mode, or the current control sequence, or the
		current rule.
 ]=	cork	exits output mode and adjoins the top two output strings,
		decreasing the stack count by one.
 backspace backspace  drops the top string from the output stack.

Flow control

 -&gt;  pipe into	pops the top output string and prepends it as a new input
		extent to the current input, separated by a ]= (cork) byte. The
		new input shall either be passed as such to the rest of the
		rule, if it starts with a 7-bit ascii character, or be
		processed by a new instance of the rule-matching virtual
		machine if it starts with an opcode. After the called-up rule
		matches, its output becomes the new input and the calling rule
		continues, but in case of a later failure the rule-matching
		machine is invoked in a loop until a match is obtained
		(success) or no more rules are available (failure).
 convert	convert null opcode, matches itself and returns what follows
		in its input extent. Typically used before another opcode in
		a -&gt; (pipe into) operation, in order for its contents to get
		a chance to be examined as input by the rest of the rule before
		being ``converted'' by a new rule-matching passage.
 ]	end	successfully terminates the current rule, the output mode, or
		any of the compound sub-rules described below.
 1[    optional  executes the enclosed subrule (up to a matching <q>]</q>) 0 or 1
		times, reporting success to the containing rule.
 [	repeat	repeats the enclosed subrule (up to a matching <q>]</q>) 0 or more
		times until it fails, reporting success to the containing rule
		and appending each output to the top output string.
 r[	recur	repeats the enclosed subrule (up to a matching <q>]</q>) 0 or more
		times until it fails, reporting success to the containing rule
		and replacing the top output string by each output.
 ifnot[	if not	succeeds if the enclosed subrule fails, and fails if the
		enclosed subrule (up to a closing <q>]</q>) matches, discarding its
		output.
 unless[	unless	succeeds if the enclosed subrule fails and fails if the
		enclosed subrule (up to a closing <q>]</q>) matches, appending its
		output to the output stream.
 #	number	(followed by a decimal digit or label) when used in input mode,
		recalls a string from the output stack (by the same numbering
		scheme as in output mode), and executes it as a string of
		bytecodes, as if they were inserted in the current rule at
		the current position.
 cut	cut	like the Prolog <q>cut</q>, asserts that failure beyond its
		position is not intended to occur. If the present rule fails
		after a cut, an error will be reported rather than moving on to
		the next rule. In addition, cut has lower priority than all
		other opcodes except ], so if two rules are identical up to
		where a cut appears, the cut rule will be tried last.

 Dictionary manipulation

 ]-&gt;	save	 (followed by a single byte) saves the top output string to the
		dictionary as a new rule, in the same scope as rules starting
		with the following opcode, or in the current scope if the
		following byte is null.
 openscope open scope  opens a new scope.
 closescope close scope	closes the current scope and erases all rules generated
		since the last openscope.
 mergescope merge scope	closes the current scope and merges all rules generated
		since the last openscope into the previous scope.
 delete	delete	deletes from the dictionary all rules that begin with the byte
		sequence contained in the top output string and belong in the
		current scope.

File handling

 open	open	opens a file for output, taking its name from the top output
		string.
 close	close	closes the current output file, resuming output to the
		previously opened one.
 ]-&gt;out write out  writes the top output string to the current output file and
		pops it off the output stack.
 include	include  opens a file for input, taking its name from the top
		output string, and includes it at the current position in the
		input stream, followed by a ]= (cork). At the end of this file
		the file will be closed and the previous input will resume
		automatically.
 closein	close input  forces closing the current input file, resuming
		input from where it was in the previously opened one.

Shortcut opcodes

 spaces	spaces	matches a sequence of zero or more blank characters (spaces and
		tabs).
 &lowast;]=  copy all   copies all remaining characters from the last input extent to
		the output stream, reading but not copying the next cork.
		Nearly equivalent to &lowast; ]=, but notice that the boundary of an
		input extent is internally marked, so &lowast;]= will copy all of it
		even if it contains an internal ]= (cork).
 =[]  put end	opens an empty new string in the output stack and goes back to
		input mode; single opcode equivalent to =[ ].
 do	do	starts execution of the rule that begins with the next bytecode
		in a new virtual machine; functionally equivalent to a
		single-byte -&gt; (pipe).
 ]&gt;	append	appends the top output string to the rule that starts with the
		following bytecode. Useful for the temporary storage of
		multi-line strings.
 get	get	a do (do) replacement that only executes a rule composed of a
		single =[ (put), presumably created by a sequence of ]&gt;
		(append) operations, and deletes the rule at the same time. It
		operates by reference, which for long strings speeds up
		execution.

Debugging

 ]-&gt;error cast error  writes the top output string to stderr and terminates
		execution in error.
 trace	trace	toggles in and out of <a href="#Trace-mode">Trace mode</a>, where an interactive
		animation of the rule-matching process is displayed on the
		controlling terminal.
 LineNo line number  writes the current input-file line number to the output
		stream.
 list-&gt;	list	extracts from the dictionary all the rules that begin with the
		byte sequence provided in the top output string, and prepends
		them one after another to the input, each one as a new input
		extent separated by a ]= (cork), with an empty input extent
		terminating the whole list.
 wrsym write symbol  disassembles the opcode provided in the top output
		byte and replaces it by its symbolic name.
 display display  displays the top output string on the controlling terminal.

Miscellaneous, less frequently used operations

 ## scope number  only valid in output mode, recalls the current scope
		identifier so it can later be used in a ]-&gt; (save) operation.
 =&gt; force write  appends everything that follows to the output stream in an
		8-bit safe way, including any opcodes that might terminate a
		normal =[ (put).
 AssignStrand assign strand  decrements an internal counter and outputs the
		next available rule strand (still unused null opcode).
 UniqueNo unique number  increments and outputs (in decimal ascii) the
		internal Unique Number counter, made available in order to
		assign unambiguous identifiers to variables.
 pushNo push number  pushes the value of the Unique Number counter (as a binary
		integer) onto the output stream.
 popNo pop number  pops the value of the Unique Number counter (as a binary
		integer) from the output stream.
 writeimage write image  writes a binary image of the whole dictionary to the
		output file (so it can later be quickly reloaded rather
		retranslated).
 readimage read image  reads in a binary dictionary image prepared by
		writeimage.
 newer	newer  matches if the file named in the top output string exists
		and is newer (has an equal or more recent modification time)
		than the current input file.
 wrinputpos write input position  writes the input-stream position pointer
		(as a binary sequence of bytes) to the output stream.
 rdinputpos read input position  pops the input-stream position pointer (as a
		binary sequence of bytes) from the output stream, effectively
		resuming input from where it was when wrinputpos was invoked.
 cpinputpos copy input position  outputs the input-stream chunk going from the
		position previously marked by wrinputpos to the current input
		position.
 ascii	ascii	outputs the character or bytecode denoted in hexadecimal
		notation by the next two input characters.
 \	(followed by two bytes)  outputs the character or bytecode denoted
		in hexadecimal notation by the next two rule bytes.
 shell command shell command  passes the top output string to the operating
		system shell for execution as a command.

<hr> <h3>The fri command line</h3>
Usage:	      fri [rule file] [-e command] [-i] [data file] ...

All arguments are optional. fri called with no arguments displays its copyright and version message and exits.

The rule file contains a list of FRI rules and optionally a -e clause. It can also redefine the syntax of the command line itself, as for instance the CPL compiler does, in which case no -e clause need appear. An initial line beginning with # is ignored, and allows the rule file to be made executable in a unix shell by declaring fri as its interpreter.

If the -e clause appears either inside the rule file or on the command line, the remaining parameters are interpreted as data files to act upon. A file name of - stands for stdin. If no data files are listed, input is taken from stdin.

The command specified in FRI syntax by the -e clause is executed in a loop until the end of input, copying one character from input to output every time the command fails. This feature allows simple sed-like scripts to be specified on the command line itself. The command that succeeds may consume one or more or even all characters.

If the -i option is present, each data file is overwritten in place; otherwise each file is acted upon in a sequence and its result catenated to stdout.

EXAMPLES

cat replacement:
	fri -e copy

tac replacement:
	fri -e 'r[ =[ &lowast; \n =[\n #2]=]'

change oranges to apples:
	fri -e '<q>orange</q> =[<q>apple</q>]'

<hr> <h3>Trace mode</h3>
When the fri compiler-interpreter runs in trace mode, which can be toggled by the <q>trace</q> bytecode, a screenful of information is displayed on the user's ANSI terminal, in a format where ascii characters are colored in yellow and FRI opcodes and strands are disassembled to their symbolic names colored in blue.

The top two lines contain a running view of the input buffer, with a marker pointing at the current position of the input pointer, and the current input line number and file name displayed at its left.

The next two lines contain a similar view of the output buffer, centered about the current position of the output pointer. The statistics collected at its left are: current scope depth in the dictionary, cut toggle, occupied number of bytes in the output buffer, current depth of the output stack.

The following lines contain a running view of the presently executing dictionary rule. Every time a -&gt; (pipe into) is executed a new line is started, so that the suspended calling lines remain visible above it. The green label on the left is the strand (first bytecode) of each rule. The next branching to follow the current instruction is also displayed, with alternatives vertically listed below the currently executing line.

Tracing proceeds as an animation, with one instruction being executed every 0.7 seconds and the display being updated accordingly. The following single-key commands modify it interactively:

 ? or /	help	display a list of these single-key commands.
 q	quit	stop execution and quit the interpreter.
 c	continue	exit trace mode and continue normally.
 s	slow	toggle in and out of slow mode, which also traces single ascii
		characters and other trivial bytecodes that are normally
		skipped over. 
 p or esc	pause	pause execution. Any key will resume.
 &lt;- -&gt;		 horizontally scroll the input, output and current-instruction
		lines. Focus is re-centered on exit from pause.
 l	list	followed by the stem of a dictionary rule in assembler
		notation, displays all the dictionary rules that start
		with that stem.
 # or 3	number	followed by a number and Enter, displays the corresponding
		output stack line. Followed by just Enter, displays the last
		few lines of the stack.
 b	backfiles  displays the stack of currently open input filenames.
 tab	complete  run to the end of the current displayed line with tracing
		suspended, and resume tracing upon return to the line above it.
 space 		fast-forward through tracing as long as the key is pressed, and
		resume the normal 0.7-second rate once released.

<hr> <h3>Arithmetic mode</h3>
For the purpose of a more traditional CPU emulation (used by <a href="cpl.html#icpl">(cpl)icpl</a>), fri provides an additional set of opcodes that specify arithmetic operations. These become active in an ad-hoc <q>arithmetic mode</q> that exists alongside input and output modes. Most arithmetic opcodes manipulate the fri output buffer as a stack of fixed-width objects (binary integers, machine addresses, floats) irrespective of its subdivision in strings. Nevertheless the subdivision remains in action, and output strings serve double use as stack frames. A <q>stack address</q> in what follows is a binary integer expressing a byte count relative to the frame.

 compute[ compute  activates arithmetic mode for the following bytecodes
